# Enigma Self Assessment

### Functionality
- 3: I successfully implemented the Enigma class with the encrypt and decrypt methods and was able to implement the command line successfully.

### Object Oriented Programming
- 2: Not counting encrypt and decrypt i only have 1 class and 1 module, for this "small" project that does not have to deal with multiple things like futbol I have found it difficult to break code into a new class that is not unreasonably small(I know of 2 methods that can be split but seems to little for a class). As of writing this README i do have a branch that has a new class and 4 methods but has more error's than expected that I'm trying to work through.(if this is still here I did not fix it in time)

### Ruby Conventions and mechanics
- 3: 2 of my methods are currently over 10 lines, but other than that I believe its at level 4

### Test Driven Development
- 4: I believe i got a 4 because every method is tested and i have used stubs for the random aspects of this project and have a 100% test coverage.

### Version Control
- 3 - 4: I am not fully sure, I have 62 commits as of witting this readme and 13 pull request each with related code that was changed in a refactor or added functionality but I don't know if was specific enough on what i wrote in the pull requests for a 4.
